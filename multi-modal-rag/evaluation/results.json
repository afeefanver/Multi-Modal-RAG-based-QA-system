      "answer": "Based on the provided information from [Source 5, Page 39], Qatar's non-hydrocarbon GDP in 2023 was 470.8 billion Qatari Riyals. To calculate the growth rate of non-hydrocarbon GDP in 2023, we need the non-hydrocarbon GDP data for the previous year (2022), which is 477.7 billion Qatari Riyals.\n\nThe growth rate formula is: \nNon-hydrocarbon GDP growth rate = ((Non-hydrocarbon GDP in 2023 - Non-hydrocarbon GDP in 2022) / Non-hydrocarbon GDP in 2022) * 100\n\nSubstitute the values:\nNon-hydrocarbon GDP growth rate = ((470.8 - 477.7) / 477.7) * 100\nNon-hydrocarbon GDP growth rate = (-6.9 / 477.7) * 100\nNon-hydrocarbon GDP growth rate ≈ -1.44%\n\nTherefore, Qatar's non-hydrocarbon GDP experienced a slight decline of approximately 1.44% in 2023 compared to 2022.",

      "category": "external_sector",
      "expected_answer": "Moderately stronger than fundamentals suggest",
      "answer": "Based on the IMF Article IV report, the assessment of Qatar's external position in 2023 is that it was moderately stronger than the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. This assessment is based on the External Balance Assessment (EBA-Lite) regression model, which yielded a positive Current Account (CA) gap of 2.0 percent of GDP [Source 1, Page 51]. The REER regression model suggested a negative CA gap of -4.7 percent of GDP but was considered less suitable for Qatar due to its currency peg. The report highlighted that tourism remained robust, fiscal prudence was maintained, but hydrocarbon prices normalized and exports declined in 2023 [Source 5, Page 50].",
